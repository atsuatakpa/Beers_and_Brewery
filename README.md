# Beers_and_Brewery
## Introduction
We have been provided with two dataset for Beers and Breweries and we want to perform analysis to gain insight that others could use.
Our Beer dataset contains the following:
Name: Name of the beer.
Beer ID: Unique identifier of the beer.
ABV: Alcohol by volume of the beer.
IBU: International Bitterness Units of the beer.
Brewery ID: Brewery id associated with the beer.
Style: Style of the beer.
Ounces: Ounces of beer. and the Breweries dataset contains:
Brew ID: Unique identifier of the brewery.
Name: Name of the brewery.
City: City where the brewery is located.
State: State where the brewery is located.

## Analysis
We will analyse the information and answer these question:
1. How many breweries are present in each state?
2. Merge beer data with breweries data by brewery id. Print rst 6 observations and the
last six observations to check the merged le.
3. Report the number of NA's in each column.
4. Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot
a bar chart to compare.
5. Which state has the maximum alcoholic beer? Which state has the most bitter beer?
6. Summary statistics for ABV (Alcohol by volume) variable.
7. Is there a relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw
a scatter plot.

## Plots
Visual evidence to support the analysis is provided in this repository in the Plots folder. Plot included are
1. Barchart of median alcohol content
2. Barchart of median international bitterness
3. Scatter plot of Alcohol by Volume and International Bitterness

## Conclusion
Visual evidence shows a positive correlation between the Alcohol by Volume(ABV) and the International Bitterness (IBU). However, we cannot draw complete statistical conclusions from this because there are other questions about the data we do not know such as the method that was used in gathering the data.
